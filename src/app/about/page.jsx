            I'm a photographer based in Los Angeles, California who specializes
            in photographing architecture; I also have a mild airplane
            obsession. I grew up in Ipswich, Massachusetts: a small coastal town
            that's one part postcard and one part dramatic Boston movie. <br />{" "}
            Here I was lucky enough to meet a number of amazing teachers who
            opened my eyes to the world of art and design; this would alter the
            path of my life in more ways than I could ever imagine. After
            studying studio art and environmental science at the University of
            Vermont, I moved to Lake Tahoe, California, in hopes of becoming a
            professional snowboarder (graduating right after the '08 recession
            made this seem like a great idea). <br /> A couple of years and too
            many injuries later, I found myself taking up an offer to photograph
            a few homes for a client I'd met while recuperating. What started by
            chance turned out to be the perfect mix of technical challenge and
            creative outlet, and I decided right there and then that it
            absolutely must be my career. In 2018, I founded the Architectural
            Photography Almanac, a resource for architecture photographers and
            those in the architecture industry seeking to learn about the craft
            and theory of architectural photography.
